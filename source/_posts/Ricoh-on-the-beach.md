So today I went for a walk on the beach with my Ricoh GR II. It was nice, although the exposure settings were out of wack. I tried to use a little exposure comp but who knows what may come out. Let's see when we get the RAWs in...

We drove there in a leaf, I think it must have been the tekna+ it had like 380km on the GOM.
